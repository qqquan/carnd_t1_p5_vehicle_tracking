**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

###Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

####1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the function get_hog_features() and getFeatures() at `FeatureExtractor_Hog.py`.  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

####2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and feed them to train the model. The following parameters shows a satisfactory performance in my testing: 

| Prameter        | Value         |
| --------------- |:-------------:|
| Color space     | YCrCb         |
| orientations    | 9             |
| pixels_per_cell | 8             |
| cell_per_block  | 2             |
| spatial_shape   | (32, 32)      |
| histogram bins  | 32            |

In general, pixels_per_cell captures the key car features, such as lamps and windows, in the  6xx64 training data. The color space isolates out the illumination effect to be possible supressed in the model. The other parameters more or less provide a lot more data or details of the feature to be fed to model training. The trade-off is that smaller feature vector improves the video processing time, while bigger vector improves model prediction accuracy.

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

###Further Work

####1. Use HOG on a window-cropped image instead of the speedy HOG mapping method

To speed up feature extration, a HOG mapping method is used. Instead of apply HOG on each sub-image, a full video frame is fed to HOG. This give a HOG result matrix. Then we map the 64x64 window to the HOG matrix. 
However, there is difference between indivisual sub-image HOG result and the HOG map result. Each sub-image has a hard cut-off on the edge of its image, while the full image HOG offers gradience information between windows. 
The HOG mapping method is only an approximation to sub-image approximation. The classifier training uses the 64x64 data, so the HOG mapping method on the video mframe is essentially not consisstent with the training inputs to the classifier. As the result, although it improves the speed, the accuracy suffers. 
I tested on cropped fifty 64x64 images from a video frame. It give zero false positive. On the other hand, the full image scan makes 6~10 false positive predictions. 
As a fater computer can be used to speed up the process, sub-image HOG method can be used in the future development to improve accuracy.
